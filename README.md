- `.config`: X11/i3 with picom and feh. the highlight is probably my i3 config, which isn't much different from the generated one but arranged more sensibly, with dmenu and bumblebee-status config at the top.
- `scripts`: used essentially like aliases, but i keep them as executable files out of habit
